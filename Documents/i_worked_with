Date:    Feb 2nd 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 10 hours

Partner Score: 3

Group Analysis:  
	Our group was able to work well with each other and accomplish what we set out too, we did however have alot of time where we were stuck on Merge_Sort 
	because of one little line of code. We spent alot of time in the debugger and could not figure out what was wrong. We eventually did figure it out and
	everything worked out in the end.
